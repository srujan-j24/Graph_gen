# Graph_gen:
## A web page to generate Graph made with HTML, CSS ans Vanilla JS.

### My take-aways from this mini-project:
- DOM-Manipulation using pure JS
- Use-case of CSS variables
- JS Clousures to a understanble extent
- Basics of Regex

### My Opinion
- This is my first completed working project with vanilla JS, even-though many are on the way.
- I have a huge respect to JS frameworks which give us nice sugar-coating to build faster.
